@rlivsey good luck with the #rubymanor talk!
Thanks, Tweetie, for autocompleting my hashtags but then truncating them #wtf #rubymanor
The only thing I dislike about @rubymanor is that doing errands for The Guvner doesn't leave as much time to speak to people as I would like
@rubymanor is great again. Good content for a fraction of the cost of other conferences. Why aren't there more like this ? #ruby
Too bad #rubymanor is sold out :( Looks like fun!
@robbyrussell would do if there was wifi! Sorry! Some great presentations so far. #rubymanor
Lunch ends in 10 minutes. We start with Paul Battley's secrets of the stdlib.
Wishing I were at #rubymanor right now... who wants to Skype me in?
In the Norfolk arms, sandwich street. Lunch. #rubymanor
